Organizer module
===============

OVERVIEW
================================================================================
	The Organizer module is used to create timeslots for students to register to.

	An organizer consists of three views:
	1) Appointments view, which allows teachers to create, remove, modify, grade 
		and print timeslots and made appointments
	2) Student view, which allows students to register to time slots created by 
		teachers. Teachers have limited use of this view as they cannot register
		to time slots.
	3) Registration status view, which provides a concise overview over students'
		registration status. Here a teacher can send reminders to students that 
		haven't had and completed an appointment yet.

	Teachers have access to all three views, while students can access only the 
	student view (no. 2).
	
	If a group organizer is created, an existing grouping MUST be provided. 
	Additionally, all groups contained in the grouping MUST be disjunct (i.e. 
	no student can be in more than one group). Registration of a group can be 
	done by any student belonging to it.
